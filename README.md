## The Yellow Paper cheat sheet

This is intended as a quick reference for some of the symbols, functions and conventions in the [Ethereum Yellow Paper](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper/).

It is still a work in progress. Things to do:

 * Complete the TODOs in the document.
 * Add more stuff! In particular, I've more-or-less ignored the appendices for now.
 * Add a little further explanation where appropriate.
 * Consider the format - could it usefully be made more compact?
 * [Stretch goal] Link with the original YP so that it can contain cross-references to equations and sections.

PRs welcome in due course, but might be worth waiting a little while to let things settle down.
